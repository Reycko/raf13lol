year age 14 of

i code a lot

that's about all i do

i mainly code in what i need to use

**Programming langanges im confident in from a scale of 1-5 (completely has no meaing, doesn't mean i am a master just means i can work with it if needed):**
- JS/TS - im pretty confident maybe like a 4.5
- C# - same with this but i think maybe a teeny bit more confident so 4.5125
- Haxe - haven't used this in a bit but i am confident with it (was my first main programming langauge) ~4.5
- Python - i only really use this to automate tasks so like 3.85
- C/C++ - Not so sure about these two, at least with base libraries so ill go 2.5
- GameMakerLanguage - haven't also used this in a bit but also quite confident so 4.45
- HTML/CSS - uhh dont really make websites so like 3-3.5
<!--conflicted on whether to add gbz80 or not-->

any repo of mine that starts with `Xthing-` basically is just a "random" thing in X that i did/am doing (not likely doing)

that's about it

maybe i should add more, that's for later
