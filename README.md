year age 13 of

i code a lot

that's about all i do

i mainly code in what i need to use

**Programming langanges im confident in from a scale of 1-5:**
- JS/TS - im pretty confident maybe like a 4.5 or 5
- C# - same with this but i think maybe a teeny bit more confident so 4.6
- Haxe - haven't used this in a bit but i am very confident with it (was my first main programming langauge) 5
- Python - i only really use this to automate tasks so like 4
- C/C++ - Not so sure about these two, at least with base libraries so ill go 2.5
- GameMakerLanguage - haven't also used this in a bit but also quite confident so 4.75
- HTML/CSS - uhh dont really make websites so like 3-3.5
<!--conflicted on whether to add gbz80 or not-->

that's about it

maybe i should add more, that's for later
